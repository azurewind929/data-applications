This interactive shiny program uses Iris dataset available in R. The Iris dataset was introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher (1936) as an example of discriminant analysis. It consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris: Iris sets, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. In this dataset, the length and the width of the sepals and petals were measured from each sample in centimetres.

In current interactive program, user can choose which species of Iris they are interested in, among the three choices available. They will also choose which feature they want to explore. The default setting is the length of sepal for Iris setosa. A histogram according to userâ€™s choice will be generated, followed by a summary chart of the data used. User can also choose the date of the analysis.
